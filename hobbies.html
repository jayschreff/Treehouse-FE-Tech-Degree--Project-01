            <h1>Gardening</h1>
            <p>When I am not in front of a computer screen, my favorite thing to do is garden. I love growing my own food and flowers. When winter comes and itâ€™s no longer possible to garden outdoors, I bring my garden inside and grow hydroponically. This is the best of both worlds because I get to combine gardening with technology. </p>

            <h1>Technology</h1>
            <p>I have always been interested in technology and I love to learn new things. Staying up to date on the latest gadgets is important to be because I love seeing technology change and evolve. If friends and family ever have a question or issue about it they know who to come to first! </p>

            <h1>Camping</h1>
            <p>I enjoy camping with my family and taking long weekend trips. I love to explore nature and get outdoors as much as I can. One if my long term goals is to work remotely from an RV and travel the county. </p>
